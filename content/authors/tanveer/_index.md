I am a fifth-year PhD student at the Department of Astronomy, Harvard University. My research interests include observational cosmology, specifically large-scale structure and the CMB, and developing statistical techniques to analyze such cosmological datasets. I work under the supervision of Dr. Daniel Eisenstein in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, whose goal is to measure the expansion rate of the Universe over the past 11 billion years. The broad goals of my dissertation are inferences of cosmological parameters and testing cosmological models using multi-tracer datasets.  

Outside of research, I am interested in Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB) efforts in academia, mentoring and outreach. In my spare time, I enjoy learning (human) languages, reading books and travelling.
